# General Information

This repository is a collection of the governing documents of the Associated Students of Walla Walla University. It is designed and hosted in such a way that encourages consistent and trackable amendments to the documents.

## LaTeX

The documents in this repository are built on a document preparation software and markup language called [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), which has the following benefits:

- **Separation of presentation from content**: LaTeX attempts to follow the design philosophy of separating presentation from content, so that authors can focus on the content of what they are writing without attending simultaneously to its visual appearance. In preparing a LaTeX document, the author specifies the logical structure using simple, familiar concepts such as chapter, section, table, figure, etc., and lets the LaTeX system handle the formatting and layout of these structures. As a result, it encourages the separation of the layout from the content â€” while still allowing manual typesetting adjustments whenever needed. This concept is similar to the mechanism by which many word processors allow styles to be defined globally for an entire document, or the use of Cascading Style Sheets in styling HTML documents.
- **Custom and consistent presentation:** LaTeX is a markup language that handles typesetting and rendering. It can be configured with custom macros that defines new environments and commands. This allows for design flexibility to obtain a professional and well-organized layout of the governing documents. Additionally, the style and layout of documents can be easily replicated to other documents for consistently of appearance and navigation.
